    <h1>About Our Business</h1>
    <div id="about-us">
        <p>We are a family owned and operated ice cream truck business located in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. In 2010, we purchased a retired DHL delivery truck and transformed it into the ice cream truck you can see today.</p>
        <p>My wife, son, daughter and I started doing events in 2011. I originally built the truck to sell ice cream at car shows and cruise-ins, but since then our business has grown into serving at a variety of events, including: <span>Car Shows, Sporting Events, Craft Shows, Corporate Events, Birthday Parties, Weddings, Church Events, Picnics, and any place an ice cream truck is needed!</span></p>
        <p id="disclaimer"><em>Note: Due to the amount of prep work involved in operating our business, we require a "minimum in sales" to do private events. Please <a href=contact.html>contact us</a> for more information.</em></p>
